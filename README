Sharp Tools spreadsheet was originally a Software Engineering course project
finished in the fall of 2000 by five CS students at Columbia University. It
is not a commecial product, nor is it meant to replace StarOffice, but it has
all the basic functionality as a spreadsheet.  We also hope people can learn
from the code. 

This is a development version.  The documentation may be inaccurate.

===================================
Build and Run
===================================

If you want to build/run your own code, do the following (assuming Unix):

$ cd src
$ make
$ jar cvf SharpTools.jar *.class
$ mv SharpTools.jar ../bin
$ cd ../bin
$ ./SharpTools

You have to do so if you check out the code from CVS.

===================================
Database
===================================

If you want to use the new database function, you need to download the JDBC
driver(s) and put in CLASSPATH (edit SharpTools or SharpTools.bat).

Below are some such websites:
