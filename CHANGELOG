===================================

The latest snapshot

- Fixed bin/SharpTools so you can execute from a different directory
  (SharpTools.bat still has to be executed in the bin directory - anyone
  knows how to fix?  Please let me know.)
- Fixed one line in SharpTools.java.  Before if there is no "SAVEWINDOW" line
  in sharptools.ini it would raise a NullPointer exception.
  (thanks to Rahul Parmer for reporting this bug)

1.2

- Column headers enabled
- Column width can be dynamically adjusted

1.1

- Rewrote base dialog class (SharpDialog) and all other dialog subclasses;
  this makes creating new dialogs much easier
- Shariz Kanga <skanga@bigfoot.com> made Sharp Tools able to import tables
  from a database by JDBC.  Tested with HSQL and Oracle (by Shariz) and
  MySQL (by me).
- Use extention file name ".cvs" instead of ".sts".
- Put stuff in jar files.

If you want to use the new database function, you need to download the JDBC
driver(s) and put in CLASSPATH (edit SharpTools or SharpTools.bat).

Below are some such websites:

MySQL: http://www.worldserver.com/mm.mysql/
HSQL: http://sourceforge.net/projects/hsqldb/
